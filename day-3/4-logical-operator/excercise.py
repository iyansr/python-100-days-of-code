# Love Calculator ðŸ’ª This is a Difficult Challenge ðŸ’ª Instructions You are going to write a program that tests the
# compatibility between two people. We're going to use the super scientific method recommended by BuzzFeed.
#
# To work out the love score between two people:
#
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. Then check for the
# number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
#
# This video gives you more details on this:
#
#
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
#
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
#
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
#
# "Your score is **z**."
#
# e.g.
#
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
#
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
#
# T occurs 0 times
#
# R occurs 1 time
#
# U occurs 2 times
#
# E occurs 2 times
#
# Total = 5
#
# L occurs 1 time
#
# O occurs 0 times
#
# V occurs 0 times
#
# E occurs 2 times
#
# Total = 3
#
# Love Score = 53
#
# Print: "Your score is 53."
